The Project Was my First Semester Final Project on Python

<--------------- THE IDEA ----------------->
The idea about this project was to make a caeser cipher that decrypts and Encrypts text based words and Translates based on the shift key used ...

<------------- FURTHERMORE ---------------->
The ceaser cipher has an audio module that welcomes the user before proceeding..
