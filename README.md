## Description

This is a tool for encryption and decryption that uses the Caesar cypher algorithm.
By changing the alphabetic letters, this programme enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages.
It is a simple illustration of a traditional cryptography method.

## Features
ðŸš€Encryption of messages using a specified shift value.

ðŸš€Decryption of previously encrypted messages.
ðŸš€Handling of both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving non-alphabetical characters.

The Project Was my First Semester Final Project on Python

## THE IDEA 
The idea about this project was to make a caeser cipher that decrypts and Encrypts text based words and Translates based on the shift key used ...

## FURTHERMORE 
The ceaser cipher has an audio module that welcomes the user before proceeding..

## ADDITION 
Feel free to commit and add new features to the code...
